<!-- Project 3 README -->
<!-- HW - 4 Addition October 25th
  First the starting pages of the Style.css, Index.html, and the README.md pages were added to the repository

  Next, the color scheme was chosen to reflect a muted darkened color scheme as I will be doing a blog post
  that pertains to my embarkment on TinType Photography.

  All of the photographs and content will be coming from myself and the website alternativephotography.com

  I want to document the processes that i will be partaking in for an assignment in another class so if I
  would like to re create this photo shoot I can do so.

  For the author information, I will provide a link to my personal web blog already. Additionally I will
  discuss my other works in photography that primarily deal in film and analog processes.

  The Colors will be as followed:
  HEX: #3f5085	R: 63	G: 80	B: 133	C: 53	M: 40	Y: 0	K: 48
  HEX: #614391	R: 97	G: 67	B: 145	C: 33	M: 54	Y: 0	K: 43
  HEX: #3b8273	R: 59	G: 130	B: 115	C: 55	M: 0	Y: 12	K: 49

  ./images/example.jpg is a reference point for the work of photography I will be doing
