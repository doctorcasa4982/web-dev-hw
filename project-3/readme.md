<!-- Project 3 README -->
<!-- HW - 4 Addition October 25th
  First the starting pages of the Style.css, Index.html, and the README.md pages were added to the repository

  Next, the color scheme was chosen to reflect a muted darkened color scheme as I will be doing a blog post
  that pertains to my embarkment on TinType Photography.

  All of the photographs and content will be coming from myself and the website alternativephotography.com

  I want to document the processes that i will be partaking in for an assignment in another class so if I
  would like to re create this photo shoot I can do so.

  For the author information, I will provide a link to my personal web blog already. Additionally I will
  discuss my other works in photography that primarily deal in film and analog processes.

  The Colors will be as followed:
  HEX: #3f5085	R: 63	G: 80	B: 133	C: 53	M: 40	Y: 0	K: 48
  HEX: #614391	R: 97	G: 67	B: 145	C: 33	M: 54	Y: 0	K: 43
  HEX: #3b8273	R: 59	G: 130	B: 115	C: 55	M: 0	Y: 12	K: 49

  ./images/example.jpg is a reference point for the work of photography I will be doing

  HW 5 Addition of December 4th

  I am so sorry for the delay to posting this. Here is what I have done.

  I added all the required elements from the homework on Typography.
  To incorperate a pseduo element I took inspiration from the w3schools.com website and created a navigation bar that rests at the top of each page using the color schemes to determine which page is currently active in the navigation. This way there is a consistant element throughout all the pages.

  I added the use of black for text as I felt it complimented the rest of the color scheme. On top of the very clean and cut text I wanted to add a professional looking script text for the quote added to the about me page.

  For the sample page I plan to have it include a breif history of Tintype through a few images.

  I really appreciate the stretch room for getting these assignments done. Though I understand what i ma doing, staying on top of coding has been a bit of a hassle. I plan to get completely caught up today though.
