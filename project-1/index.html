      <h2>Have one on me</h2>

<br>Twenty miles left to the show
<br>Hello, my old country, hello
<br>Stars are just beginning to appear
<br>And I have never in my life, before been here</br>

<br>And it's not my heart, not me, who cannot drive
<br>At which conclusion you arrived
<br>Watching me sit here bolt upright and cry
<br>For no good reason at the Eastering sky</br>

<br>And the tilt of this strange nation
<br>And the will to remain for the duration
<br>Waving the flag
<br>Feeling it drag</br>

<br>Like a bump on a bump on a log, baby
<br>Like I'm in a fist fight with a fog, baby
<br>Step-ball-change and a pirouette
<br>And I regret, I regret</br>

<br>How I said to you, "honey, just open your heart"
<br>When I've got trouble even opening a honey jar
<br>And that right there is where we are...</br>

<br>And I been 'fessing double fast
<br>Addressing questions nobody asked
<br>I'll get this joy off of my chest at last
<br>And I will love you 'til the noise has long since passed</br>

<br>And I did not mean to shout, just drive
<br>Just get us out, dead or alive
<br>A road too long to mention, lord, it's something to see!
<br>Laid down by the good intentions paving company</br>

<br>All the way to the thing we've been playing at, darlin'
<br>I can see that you're wearing your staying hat, darlin'
<br>For the time being all is well
<br>Won't you love me a spell?</br>

<br>This is blindness beyond all conceiving
<br>Well, behind us the road is leaving, yeah, leaving
<br>And falling back
<br>Like a rope gone slack</br>

<br>Well, I saw straight away that the lay was steep
<br>But I fell for you, honey, as easy as falling asleep
<br>And that right there is the course I keep...</br>

<br>And no amount of talking
<br>Is going to soften the fall
<br>But, like after the rain, step out
<br>Of the overhang, that's all</br>

<br>It had a nice a ring to it
<br>When the ol' opry house rang
<br>So with a solemn auld lang
<br>Signed, sealed, delivered, I sang</br>

<br>And there is hesitation
<br>And it always remains
<br>Concerning you, me
<br>And the rest of the gang</br>

<br>And in our quiet hour
<br>I feel I see everything
<br>And am in love with the hook
<br>Upon which everyone hangs</br>

<br>And I know you meant to show the extent
<br>To which you gave a goddang
<br>You ranged real hot and real cold but I'm sold
<br>I am home on that range</br>

<br>And I do hate to fold
<br>Right here at the top of my game
<br>When I've been trying with my whole heart and soul
<br>To stay right here in the right lane</br>

<br>But it can make you feel over and old
<br>Lord, you know it's a shame
<br>When I only want for you to pull over and hold me
<br>'Til I can't remember my own </br>
